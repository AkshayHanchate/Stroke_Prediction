Stroke Prediction Using Machine Learning
Project Overview
This project aims to predict the likelihood of a stroke using a machine learning model trained on relevant health-related features. The model takes into account various demographic and clinical factors to generate predictions that can help identify individuals at higher risk of stroke.

The project is developed in Python using the Jupyter Notebook environment. It leverages common data science libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and others for data processing, model building, and evaluation.


Key Features
Data Ingestion: The data is ingested and processed in the notebook for further analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizations and statistical summaries are included to explore the dataset.

Modeling: Multiple machine learning models are trained and evaluated, including:

Logistic Regression
Decision Trees
Random Forest
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Neural Networks (Optional)
Evaluation: Performance is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Confusion matrices and ROC curves are also generated for model comparison.

Feature Importance: Post-modeling, feature importance is analyzed to understand the impact of different health factors on stroke prediction.

Future Work
Potential future enhancements to this project include:

Hyperparameter Tuning: Improve model performance through advanced techniques like grid search or random search.
Deep Learning Models: Explore the use of deep learning architectures like CNNs or RNNs.
Deployment: Deploy the model using Flask or FastAPI for real-time predictions.
